The get_next_line project focuses on developing a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, handling file input in a memory-efficient way. The objective is to implement a function that returns the next line from a file or standard input each time it is called, without using the readline() or fgets() functions. By the end of the project, you will gain experience in buffer management, dynamic memory allocation, and string manipulation. You'll also learn how to handle edge cases, such as files of varying sizes, multiple consecutive newline characters, and EOF (End of File) conditions, while ensuring efficient memory usage and robust error handling.
